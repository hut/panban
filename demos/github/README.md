# GitHub Issues Backend

This is mostly a proof-of-concept to view GitHub issues from Panban, not meant for productive use.  It depends on a non-free API and it seems that not all the issues are transmitted.

This backend is also read-only.

Try this command from the root directory of this git repository:

```
./panban.py -b github ranger/ranger
```
